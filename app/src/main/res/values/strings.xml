    <string name="title_normal_permissions">Normal permissions</string>
    <string name="info_normal_permissions">Normal permissions cover areas where your app needs to access data or resources outside the app\'s sandbox, but where there\'s very little risk to the user\'s privacy or the operation of other apps. For example, permission to set the time zone is a normal permission.  If an app declares in its manifest that it needs a normal permission, the system automatically grants the app that permission at install time. The system doesn\'t prompt the user to grant normal permissions, and users cannot revoke these permissions</string>
    <string name="info_dangerous_permissions">Dangerous permissions cover areas where the app wants data or resources that involve the user\'s private information, or could potentially affect the user\'s stored data or the operation of other apps. For example, the ability to read the user\'s contacts is a dangerous permission. If an app declares that it needs a dangerous permission, the user has to explicitly grant the permission to the app. Until the user approves the permission, your app cannot provide functionality that depends on that permission.  To use a dangerous permission, your app must prompt the user to grant permission at runtime</string>
    <string name="title_info">Info</string>
    <string name="info_permissions">The purpose of a permission is to protect the privacy of an Android user. Android apps must request permission to access sensitive user data (such as contacts and SMS), as well as certain system features (such as camera and internet). Depending on the feature, the system might grant the permission automatically or might prompt the user to approve the request.  A central design point of the Android security architecture is that no app, by default, has permission to perform any operations that would adversely impact other apps, the operating system, or the user. This includes reading or writing the user\'s private data (such as contacts or emails), reading or writing another app\'s files, performing network access, keeping the device awake, and so on.  This page provides an overview to how Android permissions work, including: how permissions are presented to the user, the difference between install-time and runtime permission requests, how permissions are enforced, and the types of permissions and their groups</string>

    <string name="title_broadcast_receiver">Broadcast receiver</string>
    <string name="info_broadcast_receiver">A broadcast receiver (receiver) is an Android component which allows you to register for system or application events. All registered receivers for an event are notified by the Android runtime once this event happens.  For example, applications can register for the ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED system event which is fired once the Android system has completed the boot process</string>

    <string name="info_service">A service is a component which runs in the background without direct interaction with the user. As the service has no user interface, it is not bound to the lifecycle of an activity.  Services are used for repetitive and potentially long running operations, i.e., Internet downloads, checking for new data, data processing, updating content providers and the like.  Services run with a higher priority than inactive or invisible activities and therefore it is less likely that the Android system terminates them. Services can also be configured to be restarted if they get terminated by the Android system once sufficient system resources are available again.  It is possible to assign services the same priority as foreground activities. In this case it is required to have a visible notification active for the related service. It is frequently used for services which play videos or music.</string>

    <string name="info_activity">The Activity class is a crucial component of an Android app, and the way activities are launched and put together is a fundamental part of the platform\'s application model. Unlike programming paradigms in which apps are launched with a main() method, the Android system initiates code in an Activity instance by invoking specific callback methods that correspond to specific stages of its lifecycle.</string>
    <string name="text_file_provider">File provider</string>
    <string name="info_file_provider">ContentProvider is an Android component which encapsulates data and provides it to other applications. It is required only if you need to share data between multiple applications. For example, the contacts data is shared with other applications using ContactsProvider which is a subclass of ContentProvider.  \nFileProvider is a subclass of ContentProvider. While ContentProvider is a component that enables you to securely share any kind of data, FileProvider is used specifically for sharing the app’s internal files. The FileProvider class is part of the v4 Support Library so make sure to include it in your project.  \nTo make FileProvider work follow these three steps:  \nDefine the FileProvider in your AndroidManifest file \nCreate an XML file that contains all paths that the FileProvider will share with other applications \nBundle a valid URI in the Intent and activate it</string>

        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

    <string name="info_constraint_layout">A ConstraintLayout is a android.view.ViewGroup which allows you to position and size widgets in a flexible way.  Note: ConstraintLayout is available as a support library that you can use on Android systems starting with API level 9 (Gingerbread). As such, we are planning on enriching its API and capabilities over time. This documentation will reflect those changes.</string>
    <string name="info_relative_layout">RelativeLayout is a view group that displays child views in relative positions. The position of each view can be specified as relative to sibling elements (such as to the left-of or below another view) or in positions relative to the parent RelativeLayout area (such as aligned to the bottom, left or center).</string>
    <string name="t_relative_layout">Relative layout</string>
    <string name="t_frame_layout">Frame layout</string>
    <string name="info_frame_layout">FrameLayout is designed to block out an area on the screen to display a single item. Generally, FrameLayout should be used to hold a single child view, because it can be difficult to organize child views in a way that\'s scalable to different screen sizes without the children overlapping each other. You can, however, add multiple children to a FrameLayout and control their position within the FrameLayout by assigning gravity to each child, using the android:layout_gravity attribute.  Child views are drawn in a stack, with the most recently added child on top. The size of the FrameLayout is the size of its largest child (plus padding), visible or not (if the FrameLayout\'s parent permits). Views that are View.GONE are used for sizing only if setConsiderGoneChildrenWhenMeasuring() is set to true.</string>
    <string name="info_table_layout">A layout that arranges its children into rows and columns. A TableLayout consists of a number of TableRow objects, each defining a row (actually, you can have other children, which will be explained below). TableLayout containers do not display border lines for their rows, columns, or cells. Each row has zero or more cells; each cell can hold one View object. The table has as many columns as the row with the most cells. A table can leave cells empty. Cells can span columns, as they can in HTML.  The width of a column is defined by the row with the widest cell in that column. However, a TableLayout can specify certain columns as shrinkable or stretchable by calling setColumnShrinkable() or setColumnStretchable(). If marked as shrinkable, the column width can be shrunk to fit the table into its parent object. If marked as stretchable, it can expand in width to fit any extra space. The total width of the table is defined by its parent container. It is important to remember that a column can be both shrinkable and stretchable. In such a situation, the column will change its size to always use up the available space, but never more. Finally, you can hide a column by calling setColumnCollapsed().  The children of a TableLayout cannot specify the layout_width attribute. Width is always MATCH_PARENT. However, the layout_height attribute can be defined by a child; default value is ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT. If the child is a TableRow, then the height is always ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT.  Cells must be added to a row in increasing column order, both in code and XML. Column numbers are zero-based. If you don\'t specify a column number for a child cell, it will autoincrement to the next available column. If you skip a column number, it will be considered an empty cell in that row. See the TableLayout examples in ApiDemos for examples of creating tables in XML.  Although the typical child of a TableLayout is a TableRow, you can actually use any View subclass as a direct child of TableLayout. The View will be displayed as a single row that spans all the table columns.</string>

Customers can interact with their favorite apps in a quick, seamless way with Haptic Touch deeply integrated across iOS 13 to provide app shortcuts for everyday tasks right from the Home screen, including taking a selfie in Camera, checking an appointment in Calendar or previewing email within Mail with just a simple press.</string>
    <string name="info_earth_news">ASCENSION FLIGHTS: BRITISH COMPANY LAUNCHES FUNERAL SERVICE WHERE FAMILIES CAN SCATTER ASHES IN SPACE</string>
    <string name="info_earch_news_body">A British company is launching the first extra-terrestrial funeral service that means people can have their ashes scattered in space. Offered by Ascension Flights, the process allows families to send their loved one’s remains to the edge of Earth’s atmosphere and costs upwards of £795. Using the Ascension 1 aircraft, a person’s cremated remains are carried 22 miles up to be released into the high-altitude winds of the stratosphere before the emptied canister returns to Earth. As part of the service, the two-and-a-half hour process is also filmed on an HD camera so that friends and family can watch the ashes being scattered while residual moisture in the canister creates a plume of glitter. The launches are set to take place at the company’s South Yorkshire base but can be held elsewhere for a higher fee. Pet funerals are also on offer. All flights are authorised by the Civil Aviation Authority, which provides a launch window and warns nearby pilots. The company was formed by two ex-University of Sheffield students who appeared on Dragon’s Den with their concept and have been developing the technology for five years. “Many of the first generation of space fans will never experience space flight,” co-founder Dr Chris Rose said. “Our new service enables families the opportunity to fulfil their loved ones’ dreams. We feel it’s the ultimate send-off for a life well lived. “Fundamentally, we are all stardust, so this feels like a fitting tribute to those of us who have lived through the prologue to the space age.”</string>
    <string name="info_solar">What Spacecraft are Headed into Interstellar Space?</string>
    <string name="info_solar_body">Five spacecraft have achieved enough velocity to eventually travel beyond the boundaries of our solar system. Two of them reached the unexplored space between the stars after several decades in space.  \nVoyager 1 went interstellar in 2012 and Voyager 2 joined it in 2018. Both spacecraft are still in communication with Earth. Both spacecraft launched in 1977. \nNASA\'s New Horizons spacecraft—currently exploring the an icy region beyond Neptune called the Kuiper Belt—eventually will leave our solar system.</string>
    <string name="info_rxjava_1">RxJava is described officially as \"a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences\". \nBut what does this actually mean? Let\'s put this library into context.  One of the challenges in writing robust Android apps is the dynamic nature of changing inputs. \nIn traditional imperative programming models, values have to be explicitly set on variables for them to be updated. If one dependent value changes, the value will not be updated without adding another line of code. \nConsider the following example:</string>
    <string name="info_rxjava_code1">// init variables \nint i, j, k;   \n\n// Init inputs \ni = 1; j = 2;  \n\n// Set output value \nk = i + j;  \n\n// Update a dependent value \nj = 4; k = ?  // What should k be?</string>
    <string name="info_rxjava_2">State variables such as k intrinsically may not reflect the current value of its inputs. \nTraditional asynchronous programming approaches tend to rely on callbacks to update these changes, \nbut this way can lead to a problem known as callback hell. Reactive programming (see an intro here) addresses these issues by providing a framework to describe outputs to reflect their changing inputs. RxJava, which is a port of the Reactive Extensions library from .NET, enables Android apps to be built in this style.  Check out Kaushik\'s video introduction to RxJava talk which provides a solid overview of the library. \nFor a tutorial, check out this tutorial by Chris Arriola.</string>
    <string name="t_article">Article</string>
    <string name="info_rxjava_3">The basic building blocks of reactive code are Observables and Observers. An Observable emits items; an Observer consumes those items. An Observable may emit any number of items (including zero items), then it terminates either by successfully completing, or due to an error. An Observable can then have any number of observers. For each Observer attached, an Observable calls Observer#onNext() for every item, followed by either Observer#onComplete() or Observer#onError(). Keep in mind that Observables often don\'t start emitting items until there\'s at least one subscriber.</string>
    <string name="info_ocean">Global warming is speeding up Earth‘s massive ocean currents</string>
    <string name="info_ocean_1">The oceans’ great continent-wrapping currents, each one moving as much water as all the world’s rivers combined, can rightly be considered the planet’s circulatory system. And this circulation, it appears, has started to thump faster: For nearly 25 years the currents have been rapidly speeding up, partly because of global warming.  That’s the conclusion of a new paper today in Science Advances. Based on observations combined with models, the authors claim that from 1990 to 2013, the energy of the currents increased by some 15% per decade. “This is a really huge increase,” says Susan Wijffels, an oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. “It’s going to stimulate a lot of other work.” If the acceleration is real, it could affect jet streams, weather patterns, and the amount of heat stored in the ocean’s depths.  Oceanographers have suspected that climate warming is affecting ocean circulation, but so far, observations haven’t shown a trend, says Hu Shijian, an oceanographer at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’s Institute of Oceanology and lead author of the study. The Kuroshio Current, running up Eastern Asia, has seemed stable, whereas the Agulhas, flowing along Africa’s eastern coast, has broadened, fracturing into meandering eddies. The Atlantic Ocean’s Gulf Stream may be weakening as Arctic melt slows its driver, the sinking of salty water in the North Atlantic, whereas currents in the Pacific Ocean have seen a strong uptick. Hu decided only a global view could reveal any overall trend. \\nNo sustained, direct measurements of currents around the world are available, however. Instead, Hu’s team turned to so-called reanalyses, which combine observations of the ocean and atmosphere with computer models to fill in the gaps and produce a global picture. The approach is tricky to use for time spans of decades: Changes in observations, for example when new satellites come online, can cause unknown biases.  So Hu’s team combined five different reanalyses of ocean circulation, hoping their differing methods could reveal a true trend. From each one they extracted the ocean’s kinetic energy month by month, at a coarse scale that would ignore the turbulence of eddies and storms. And each showed a distinct rise starting around 1990.  Was it real? A look at data from the Argo array, a fleet of nearly 4000 robotic floats deployed around the world, provided the best test. The floats have been bobbing up and down in the ocean’s uppermost 2000 meters for the past 15 years, measuring temperature and salinity. They don’t track velocity through the water column. But their data do indicate where winds have piled up water, helping create differences in pressure that drive large-scale flows. By combining those data with the floats’ own current-borne trajectories, investigators can reconstruct overall currents and their speed.  The data set, compiled by oceanographer Alison Gray of the University of Washington, Seattle, covers only 6 years, from 2005 to 2010, but Hu found that it reveals an even clearer global speedup than the reanalysis models. “The evidence in the Argo data is absolutely astonishing,” says Eleanor Frajka-Williams, an oceanographer at the United Kingdom’s National Oceanography Centre, who was not part of the study.  Gray says she was startled by the magnitude of the acceleration. But she notes that ocean winds, which drive most currents, have steadily increased over the past 3 decades. And Hu says there’s good evidence that human activity has contributed to that strengthening. For example, in the Southern Hemisphere, ozone depletion and greenhouse warming have altered atmospheric circulation to push the Southern Ocean’s famed westerly winds to the south, perhaps causing a slight strengthening and spreading of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Meanwhile, heat from the warming tropical Atlantic has goosed the Walker Circulation, an equatorial pattern that drives the Pacific trade winds.  Still, natural fluctuations can’t be ruled out, says Gerrit Lohmann, a climate scientist at the Alfred Wegener Institute. Over the past few decades, long-term cooling off western North America has caused Pacific winds to pick up—and that cooling may reflect natural oscillations in the ocean’s state. Other researchers doubt these cycles exist. Either way, Hu thinks the oscillations could be responsible for at most one-third of the wind speedup.  The ocean acceleration could have globe-spanning effects. Stronger tropical currents could carry more warm water to higher latitudes, for example. Because carbon dioxide (CO2) is less soluble in warm water, that could slow the ocean’s uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere. The high-latitude warming may also be shifting weather patterns. At the same time, Hu adds that by reaching deep into the ocean, the acceleration could boost the storage of heat in the depths, helping slow the warming on land. “This is the first global study,” says Janet Sprintall, a co-author and oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “There’s a lot of uncertainty.”  Oceanographers will likely fan out to test the study’s findings. Perhaps the strongest confirmation could come from updated data from the Argo floats, due out later this year. Still, it will probably take another decade of observations to be sure the trend is real and driven by global warming, Wijffels says. “This paper does highlight how ill prepared we are to truly diagnose what’s going on.”</string>
